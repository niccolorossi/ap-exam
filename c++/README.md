# Binary Search Tree in c++
The include folder contains the implementation of the Binary Search Tree in two files named BST.h and BST.cpp. The first one is an header file, collecting functions' and methods' signatures, while the second contains almost all the function definitions. In the src folder there are two files used to test our class, namely test.cpp and benchmark.cpp. The first one was written in order to check for the correctness of our copy/move creators and assignment operators, insert function etc. while benchmark.cpp tests the performance of the lookups and compares it with std::map. In order to produce the two executables test.x and benchmark.x a Makefile is provided.
